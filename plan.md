# Implementation Plan: File Manager

**Branch**: `main` | **Date**: 2025-09-19 | **Spec**: [spec.md](spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `spec.md`

## Summary
This project is to build a local file backup and synchronization tool. The core functionality includes selecting source and destination directories, performing synchronization with reliable deduplication, and providing a web-based GUI for management. The backend will be built in Go, the frontend in Angular, and it will use SQLite for metadata storage.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Go 1.21, TypeScript (latest for Angular)
**Primary Dependencies**: Go: `github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3`, Angular: `@angular/core`
**Storage**: SQLite
**Testing**: Go testing library, Jest/Jasmine for Angular
**Target Platform**: Local desktop (cross-platform)
**Project Type**: Web application (frontend + backend)
**Performance Goals**: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: e.g., sync speed, UI responsiveness]
**Constraints**: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: e.g., memory usage, CPU load]
**Scale/Scope**: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: e.g., max number of files, max file size]

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Structure Decision**: Web application (frontend + backend)

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - Research performance goals for file synchronization tools.
   - Research typical constraints for desktop applications.
   - Define the initial scale and scope for version 1.0.

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Data Model**: The data model is defined in `apps/database/init.sql`.
2. **API Contracts**: Define the API endpoints for communication between the frontend and backend.
3. **Quickstart**: Create a `quickstart.md` guide for setting up and running the project.

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Generate tasks based on the `plan.md` and `spec.md`.
- Create tasks for backend development (API endpoints, database integration, sync logic).
- Create tasks for frontend development (UI components, API service, state management).
- Create tasks for testing (unit and integration tests for both frontend and backend).

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (`tasks.md`)
**Phase 4**: Implementation
**Phase 5**: Validation

## Progress Tracking
