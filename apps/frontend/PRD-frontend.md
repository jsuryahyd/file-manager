# Frontend PRD: File Manager Web UI

## Overview
A modern Angular-based web UI for managing local file backups and sync operations. The UI will provide robust file exploration, search, selection, and sync history features, supporting all requirements from the main project plan.

## Key Features
- **File Explorer**: Browse, search, and select files/folders from the home directory and beyond.
- **Search Capability**: Fast, fuzzy search to locate files/folders by name, type, or pattern.
- **Selection & Sync**: Multi-select files/folders to sync, with clear UI for source/destination selection.
- **Sync History**: Display last sync status, history, and logs for each file/folder.
- **Status & Feedback**: Real-time progress, error reporting, and success notifications.
- **Design System**: SCSS-based, themeable, responsive design system for consistent UI/UX.
- **Accessibility**: Keyboard navigation, screen reader support, and high-contrast mode.
- **Extensibility**: Modular components for future features (cloud sync, file analysis, graph UI, OS integration).

## User Stories
- As a user, I want to browse and search my files easily.
- As a user, I want to select multiple files/folders to sync.
- As a user, I want to see when files were last synced and view sync history.
- As a user, I want clear feedback on sync progress and errors.
- As a user, I want a beautiful, fast, and accessible UI.

## Technical Requirements
- Angular 17+ (standalone components)
- SCSS design system (customizable, themeable)
- REST API integration with Go backend
- State management (RxJS, signals)
- Responsive layout (desktop, tablet, mobile)
- Modular architecture for future expansion

## Next Steps
1. Build SCSS design system and component library.
2. Implement File Explorer screen with search and selection.
3. Integrate sync history and status features.
4. Expand to additional screens/features as needed.
