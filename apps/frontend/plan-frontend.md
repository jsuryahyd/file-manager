# Frontend Implementation Plan: File Manager Web UI

## Linked PRD
See [PRD-frontend.md](./apps/frontend/PRD-frontend.md) for product requirements and features.

## Development Phases

### 1. SCSS Design System
- Create a scalable, themeable SCSS design system.
- Define color palette, typography, spacing, and UI primitives (buttons, inputs, cards, modals, etc).
- Build reusable Angular components for design primitives.

### 2. File Explorer Screen
- Implement file/folder listing for home directory (default view).
- Add robust search (fuzzy, pattern, type) and filtering.
- Enable multi-select and clear selection UI.
- Integrate backend API for file listing and search.

### 3. Sync & History Features
- UI for selecting files/folders to sync and choosing destination.
- Display last sync status, history, and logs for each file/folder.
- Real-time progress and error feedback.

### 4. Accessibility & Responsiveness
- Ensure keyboard navigation, screen reader support, and high-contrast mode.
- Responsive layout for desktop, tablet, and mobile.

### 5. Extensibility & Future Features
- Modularize components for future cloud sync, file analysis, graph UI, OS integration.

## Commit-by-Commit Plan
1. **Design System Init**: Scaffold SCSS system, add base styles and primitives.
2. **Component Library**: Build Angular components for design primitives.
3. **File Explorer UI**: Implement explorer screen, search, selection, API integration.
4. **Sync & History UI**: Add sync controls, history display, progress feedback.
5. **Accessibility & Responsive**: Polish for accessibility and device support.
6. **Docs & Tests**: Document components, add unit/integration tests.
7. **Feature Expansion**: Prepare for future features as per PRD.

## Next Steps
- Review and approve PRD and implementation plan.
- Begin with SCSS design system and component library.
